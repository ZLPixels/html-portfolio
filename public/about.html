<h1>About Me</h1> 
<p>I have enjoyed living and traveling all over the world. Sometimes I wake up in popular-picturesque locations that takes my breath away or sometimes I awake in a little nobody-knows junctions following the freshes scent of coffee. I never feared the feeling of being lost in such a big beautiful world.  I always find my way (and my breath) back and ready for my next adventure.</p>

<p>I am learning Web Development to allow me to continue traveling. Infact, Web Development has become a journey in itself. All of the things that inspire me and make my blood pump are still fully enjoyed yet, balanced and enhanced within the parameters of Web Development.

<p>My endeavor to enjoy the world around me by taking in beautiful experiences and sharing beneficial expressions and creations has brought me into contact with many amazing people.  I continue to grow and learn we think and work as friends and associates. It is my pleasure to let my friends and me build your website!</p>
