  <h3>Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology,<br> and Legend says about birthdays...</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> 
            (it's) for people who need protection from spirits.</li>
          <li>...the presence of friends protects celebants.</li>
          <li>good wishes help to protect the celebrant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I prefer to appreciate and enjoy my friends <em>everyday</em>ðŸŽ¶! <br>Plus, I don't think they have any spirits issues</p>
  <h3>What else will I look up?</h3>
  <p>I will do more research on Birthdays, Holidays & other Rituals</p>
